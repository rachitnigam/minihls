# miniHLS: Dead simple high-level synthesis

miniHLS is a educational HLS compiler implemented in Python. It has two goals:
1. Simplicity: The compiler prioritizes design decisions that make implementing
   the tool and understanding the compiler simple.
2. Extensible: The compiler can be easily extended with optimization and analysis
   passes.

The generated code is guaranteed to run on Verilator.
